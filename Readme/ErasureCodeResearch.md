# Erasure Codes
- They are actually the base of Shamir Secret Sharing and are commonly refrenced by the name Reed Solomon Codes
which is a actual implementation of the theoretical Erasure Code
- Shamir is focused on both preserving data, but more importantly allowing specific parties to access said data
- Erasure Codes are purely focused on being able to recover data using only pieces of an encoded version of it
