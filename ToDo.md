1. Let the origin be (0,0) bottom left corner of the graph
2. Give X-axis a title and see if there is a way to compress the width. Currently, when compiled, it is looking like this (see below). Also, if possible can you plot it directly to .eps format?
3. Move the graph legend to top right for “”Retrieval times” graph.
